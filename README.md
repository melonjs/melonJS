Building melonJS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build your own version of melonJS you will need to install :

- the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) JavaScript runtime and [npm](https://npmjs.org/) package manager
- the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) task manager

Once the Node.js package manager has been installed (using the installer from their website), 
we need to install Grunt and the Grunt CLI (Command Line Interface), by doing the following :

Open a [Terminal](http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/all.html#terminal) or a [Commmand Prompt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Prompt) and 
type the following :

	$ npm install -g grunt-cli

then we can install the melonJS required dependencies, by typing :

	$ cd melonJS
	$ npm install

Once all the above done, we are ready to build melonJS :

	$ cd melonJS
	$ grunt

Both plain and minified library will be available under the "build" directory.

Building the documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
melonJS uses [JSDoc3](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc), the documentation processor, and requires [Java](http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp) to be installed, and a special `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to be set. E.g. for Mac OS X :

	$ export JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home


JSDoc also requires specific dependencies to be installed :

	$ cd melonJS
	$ cd tasks
	$ cd jsdoc
	$ npm install

Then do the following to actually build the documentation :

	$ cd melonJS
	$ grunt doc

The generated documentation will be then available under the "docs" directory

Using melonJS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Follow the tutorial [here](http://melonjs.github.io/tutorial/) to get started !

Note that due to the 'cross-origin request' policy implemented in most browsers (that prevents from accessing local files), you will need to either disable this security check (see the tutorial), or better use a "personal" local web server.
